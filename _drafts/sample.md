# Hello Jekyll ðŸ‘‹

This is a **sample blog post** written in Markdown to test how it looks on your site.

## Text Formatting
- **Bold text**
- *Italic text*
- ~~Strikethrough~~
- `Inline code`

> "A blockquote example to test styling."

## Lists
1. First ordered item  
2. Second item  
   - Nested unordered item
   - Another nested item  
3. Third item  

- [x] Completed task  
- [ ] Pending task  

## Code Block
```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}! ðŸ‘‹`;
}
console.log(greet("World"));
````

## Table

| Feature     | Status | Notes               |
| ----------- | ------ | ------------------- |
| Markdown    | âœ…      | Works great         |
| Code blocks | âœ…      | Syntax highlighting |
| Images      | âœ…      | With captions       |

## Image

![Sample Image](/assets/img/sample.jpeg)

<figure>
  <img src="/assets/img/sample.jpeg" alt="Sample Image">
  <figcaption>This is a sample caption for an image.</figcaption>
</figure>

Thatâ€™s it! ðŸŽ‰ This post demonstrates most of the Markdown elements youâ€™ll want to test in your Jekyll blog.

```

This content will help you verify headings, code blocks, lists, images, tables, footnotes, and callouts are styled correctly in your current CSS setup.  

ðŸ‘‰ Do you want me to also generate a **second post with longer article-style text** (like a real blog article on tech or personal story) so you can test multi-paragraph layouts?
